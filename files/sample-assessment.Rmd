## Rubric for 5th Grade Fractions Assessment

| Category | Exceeds Expectations (4) | Meets Expectations (3) | Approaching Expectations (2) | Below Expectations (1) |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Conceptual Understanding** | Demonstrates thorough understanding of fractions, including equivalence and comparison. Can explain concepts clearly using mathematical terminology. | Shows solid understanding of fractions. Can explain most concepts using some mathematical terms. | Demonstrates basic understanding of fractions. Explanations may lack clarity or use of mathematical terms. | Shows limited understanding of fractions. Unable to explain concepts clearly. |
| **Problem Solving** | Consistently applies appropriate strategies to solve complex fraction problems. Shows work clearly and logically. | Usually applies appropriate strategies to solve fraction problems. Work is mostly clear and logical. | Sometimes applies appropriate strategies. Work may be unclear or illogical at times. | Rarely applies appropriate strategies. Work is unclear or missing. |
| **Computational Accuracy** | Calculations with fractions are consistently accurate, including in multi-step problems. | Calculations with fractions are mostly accurate. May have minor errors in multi-step problems. | Calculations with fractions are sometimes accurate. Makes errors in basic operations. | Calculations with fractions are often inaccurate. Makes significant errors in basic operations. |
| **Representation** | Effectively uses multiple representations (diagrams, number lines, symbols) to illustrate fraction concepts and solutions. | Uses representations appropriately to illustrate fraction concepts and solutions. | Sometimes uses representations, but may be incomplete or partially incorrect. | Rarely uses representations or uses them incorrectly. |
