Module: Structure and Properties

## Module Overview

This module will deepen your understanding of often taken-for-granted fundamental mathematical properties. The module focuses on the commutative, associative, distributive, identity, and inverse properties, which are essential for developing a strong foundation in arithmetic and preparation for algebraic thinking. By exploring each of these properties, you will gain the knowledge to support students' expansion beyond the general principles of quantity and operations.

### Goals for the module

One goal for this module is for you to come up with a set of ways to describe these properties to your students. Use examples from previous modules to guide you.

## Commutative Property

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}

The commutative property states that the order of operands does not change the final result in certain mathematical operations. It applies to addition and multiplication, but not to subtraction or division.

:::

### Formal expressions:

- For addition: a + b = b + a

- For multiplication: a × b = b × a

### Examples:

#### Addition:

- 3 + 5 = 5 + 3 = 8

- 10 + 7 = 7 + 10 = 17

#### Multiplication:

- 4 × 6 = 6 × 4 = 24

- 3 × 8 = 8 × 3 = 24

#### With variables:

- x + y = y + x

- m × n = n × m
    
## Associative Properties

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}

Associative Property of Addition

The associative property of addition can be expressed as: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)

:::

### Examples:

Example 1:

(5 + 2) + 3 = 5 + (2 + 3) 

When we break this down:

- (5 + 2) + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10

- 5 + (2 + 3) = 5 + 5 = 10

As we can see, the result is the same regardless of how we group the numbers.

Example 2:

(4 + (-3)) + 11 = 4 + ((-3) + 11) 

Breaking it down:

- (4 + (-3)) + 11 = 1 + 11 = 12

- 4 + ((-3) + 11) = 4 + 8 = 12

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}

Associative Property of Multiplication

The associative property of multiplication is expressed as: (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)
:::

### Examples:

Example 3:

(2 × 3) × 5 = 2 × (3 × 5) 

Let's calculate:

- (2 × 3) × 5 = 6 × 5 = 30

- 2 × (3 × 5) = 2 × 15 = 30


Example 4:

(-4 × -3) × -5 = -4 × (-3 × -5) 

Breaking it down:

- (-4 × -3) × -5 = 12 × -5 = -60

- -4 × (-3 × -5) = -4 × 15 = -60
