# Framing mathematics and science

**Science** is the systematic study and pursuit of knowledge about the natural and physical world through observation, experimentation, and the formulation of testable hypotheses. It involves a methods-based approach to understanding phenomena and developing explanations based on empirical evidence.

**Mathematics** is the science that deals with the logic of quantity, structure, space, and change.

## Logic

Logic refers to the principles of reasoning, especially correct reasoning. It's the systematic method of coming to conclusions through rational thought. In mathematics, logic involves the formal principles of reasoning and inference used to derive valid conclusions.

## Quantity

Quantity relates to the amount or number of something that can be measured or counted. In mathematics, it deals with concepts like magnitude, size, or amount that can be expressed numerically.

## Structure

Structure in mathematics refers to the way mathematical objects are organized or arranged. It involves the relationships and patterns between mathematical entities, such as the properties of number systems or the organization of geometric shapes.

## Space

In mathematics, space refers to the framework within which points, lines, shapes, and other geometric objects exist. It can be two-dimensional (like a plane), three-dimensional (like our physical world), or even higher-dimensional in abstract mathematics.

## Change

Change in mathematics deals with how quantities or properties vary or transform over time or under different conditions. This concept is fundamental to areas like calculus, which studies rates of change and accumulation.

# Basic Concepts

## Zero

### Formal Definition 

Zero is a number that represents the absence of quantity or magnitude. It is the integer between the set of all negative integers and all positive integers.

### Examples

The empty set: $\emptyset$ or $\{ \}$.

The number line: A starting point on number line.

Counting: of you have a basket of apples and remove all of the apples, you are left with zero apples.

Temperature: On the Celsius scale, zero degrees represents the freezing point of water.

### Key Points:

Zero as a placeholder in our number system.

The role of zero in mathematics (e.g., additive identity).

Historical developments of the concept of zero:

  - Dividing a number by zero, $\dfrac{x}{0} = \text{undefined}$ for some number $x \neq 0$
  
  - Dividing zero by zero, $\dfrac{x}{0} = \text{undefined}$ for some number $x = 0$.
  
  

## Infinity

### Formal Definition

Infinity is a concept describing something without any limit, and is larger than any real number. It is often denoted by the symbol $\infty$.

### Examples

The number line: You can always add 1 to any number, no matter how large, so the number line extends infinitely.
    
Fractional division: 1 divided by 3 results in a repeating decimal (0.333...) that goes on infinitely.

### Key Points

Different types of infinity (countable and uncountable)

The concept of infinity in mathematics vs. everyday life

Paradoxes involving infinity (e.g., Hilbert's Hotel)
