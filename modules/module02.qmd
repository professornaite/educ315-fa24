Module: Numbers and Sets

## Module Overview

This module explores fundamental concepts in mathematics, focusing on numbers and sets within the context of problem-solving strategies. It is designed for teachers of grades 4-6 in urban classrooms. The module covers the history of problem-solving in mathematics, introduces George Polya's problem-solving approach, delves into number theory, and examines the concept of sets and various number systems. By the end of this module, teachers will have a comprehensive understanding of these topics and be equipped to apply problem-solving strategies in their classrooms.

## Problem Solving

Problem-solving has been a central focus in mathematics education for decades. The emphasis on problem-solving strategies gained momentum in the 1980s, with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) highlighting its importance in their standards[1]. Since then, various approaches have been developed to enhance students' problem-solving skills, including heuristic strategies, metacognitive techniques, and collaborative problem-solving.

### Who is George Polya?

George Polya (1887-1985) was a Hungarian mathematician who made significant contributions to various fields of mathematics. He is best known for his work on problem-solving, particularly his book "How to Solve It" (1945), which outlines a systematic approach to problem-solving[2].

Polya's problem-solving approach consists of four main steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: This step involves carefully reading the problem, identifying key information, and clarifying any unfamiliar terms or concepts[2].

2. **Devise a plan**: Here, the problem-solver considers various strategies and selects an appropriate approach. This may include drawing diagrams, looking for patterns, or working backwards[2].

3. **Carry out the plan**: In this step, the chosen strategy is implemented, and calculations are performed. It's important to check each step for accuracy[2].

4. **Look back**: After obtaining a solution, the problem-solver reviews their work, verifies the result, and considers alternative methods or extensions of the problem[2].

**Example 1**: Solve the equation 2x + 5 = 13

1. Understand: We need to find the value of x that makes the equation true.
2. Plan: Isolate x by subtracting 5 from both sides, then divide by 2.
3. Execute: 2x + 5 = 13
           2x = 8
           x = 4
4. Look back: Check if 2(4) + 5 = 13, which it does.

**Example 2**: Find the area of a rectangle with perimeter 24 cm and length 3 cm longer than its width.

1. Understand: We need to find the area, given the perimeter and a relationship between length and width.
2. Plan: Let w be the width. Express length as w + 3. Use the perimeter formula to find w, then calculate the area.
3. Execute: 2(w + (w + 3)) = 24
           4w + 6 = 24
           4w = 18
           w = 4.5 cm
           length = 7.5 cm
           Area = 4.5 × 7.5 = 33.75 cm²
4. Look back: Verify that the perimeter is indeed 24 cm and the length is 3 cm longer than the width.

## History of Number Theory

Number theory has a rich history of problem-solving approaches. Some famous theorems include:

1. **Fermat's Last Theorem**: Pierre de Fermat claimed in 1637 that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer n > 2. This theorem was finally proved by Andrew Wiles in 1995, after centuries of attempts[3].

2. **The Goldbach Conjecture**: Proposed by Christian Goldbach in 1742, it states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. While widely believed to be true, it remains unproven[3].

3. **The Riemann Hypothesis**: Proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, this conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers is considered one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics[3].

## Sets

A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects. Set theory provides a foundation for much of modern mathematics. Key concepts include:

- Set notation: {1, 2, 3} represents a set containing the elements 1, 2, and 3.
- Subsets: A is a subset of B if every element of A is also in B.
- Set operations: union (∪), intersection (∩), difference (-), complement.
- Venn diagrams: Visual representations of set relationships.

## Numbers

The sets of numbers form a hierarchy:

1. **Natural numbers (ℕ)**: Positive integers used for counting.
2. **Whole numbers (W)**: Natural numbers plus zero.
3. **Integers (ℤ)**: Positive and negative whole numbers.
4. **Rational numbers (ℚ)**: Numbers that can be expressed as fractions.
5. **Irrational numbers**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as fractions (e.g., π, √2).
6. **Real numbers (ℝ)**: The union of rational and irrational numbers.
7. **Complex numbers (ℂ)**: Numbers with a real and imaginary part.

## Exercises

1. Use Polya's problem-solving approach to solve: A rectangle's length is twice its width. If its perimeter is 30 cm, what are its dimensions?

2. Prove that the square root of 2 is irrational.

3. Given sets A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, find A ∪ B and A ∩ B.
