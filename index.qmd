The pages on this site outline the technical components of the **EDUC 315: Principles of Teaching Math and Science in Urban Classrooms II (Grades 4-6)** course at Howard University, taught by me: [Professor Nathan Alexander](https://professornaite.github.io). The information on this page will serve as a technical <u>*companion*</u> to our Canvas site [here](https://canvas.howard.edu/courses/53402).

This site will support you in our course in the following ways:

-   This page will help you work with the problem sets and complete small tasks over time.

-   This page will walk you through the technical aspects of pedagogical questions relevant to teaching grades 4-6.

-   This page will support your use of technique in your pedagogical practice, and increase your ability to document, deduce, prove, and assert.
