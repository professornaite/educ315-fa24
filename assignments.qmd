This page contains three sections:

-   Brief overview of <u>all</u> **course assignments**.

-   Information about **homework 0** (ungraded).

-   Information about **lab 0** (ungraded).

### **Overview of course assignments**

Our course assignments will be split between reading and typing (code and analytic results).

### **Homework 0**

For your first homework, you will complete a few computational exercises. This homework is ungraded, and while there is no prerequisite for this course, homework 0 (HW #0) should serve as a review and a preview of content that we'll explore for the course. Please do not hesitate to reach out with questions.

**Exercise 0.1**. If an individual's projected income is to be converted to a z-score, which of these z-scores would a "rational agent" prefer: -2.00, -1.00, 0, 1.00, or 2.00? What is a "rational agent"? Explain why the "rational agent" would prefer the z-score you selected? Cite any sources.

**Exercise 0.2**. What is an integer? What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? Explain your solution. Cite any sources. Bonus points (but definitely not required for our course): write a proof of the solution.

**Exercise 0.3**. Have you ever heard of p-hacking? P-hacking is where a researcher conducts multiple tests and only reports the significant results from those tests. What are some main issues here?

I will <u>**not**</u> collect hw-0 but I am happy to review it if you'd like; upload it to Canvas [here](https://canvas.howard.edu/courses/46792).

### **Lab 0**

For your first lab, you will install two software programs on your local machine: the first is base R and the second is the RStudio Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. <u>Both programs are required</u>.

::: {.callout-caution collapse="false"}
## You must download both R and RStudio!

In order to complete assignments, you must download base R and RStudio to your computer.
:::

RStudio is now called Posit. When you are searching online you will begin to see language differences.

It can all get very confusing. In order to reduce confusion, I am requesting that you watch [this short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUe_iD7RJvo) so that we're all on the same page. I will discuss this more when we meet.

### **Next up**: Computing

On the next page, I will walk you through downloading the appropriate software for our work this term.
