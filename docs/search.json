    "text": "Gladys West\n\n\nGladys Mae West, born on October 27, 1930, in Sutherland, Virginia, is a pioneering mathematician whose work significantly contributed to the development of the Global Positioning System (GPS). After earning her Bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Virginia State College in 1952 and a Master’s degree in 1955, she began her career at the U.S. Naval Proving Ground, where she developed mathematical models that accurately represented the Earth’s shape, essential for GPS technology.\nGladys West is often referred to as one of the “hidden figures” in the history of NASA and military technology, West’s contributions went largely unrecognized for many years. In 2018, she was inducted into the United States Air Force Hall of Fame and named one of the BBC’s 100 Women, highlighting her legacy in STEM and inspiring future generations, particularly women of color, to pursue careers in science and technology.\nMs. West will serve as one of many examples to guide our questions about teaching mathematics and science.

    "section": "Problem Solving",
    "text": "Problem Solving\nProblem-solving has been a central focus in mathematics education for decades. The emphasis on problem-solving strategies gained momentum in the 1980s, with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) highlighting its importance in their standards[1]. Since then, various approaches have been developed to enhance students’ problem-solving skills, including heuristic strategies, metacognitive techniques, and collaborative problem-solving.\n\nWho is George Polya?\nGeorge Polya (1887-1985) was a Hungarian mathematician who made significant contributions to various fields of mathematics. He is best known for his work on problem-solving, particularly his book “How to Solve It” (1945), which outlines a systematic approach to problem-solving[2].\nPolya’s problem-solving approach consists of four main steps:\n\nUnderstand the problem: This step involves carefully reading the problem, identifying key information, and clarifying any unfamiliar terms or concepts[2].\nDevise a plan: Here, the problem-solver considers various strategies and selects an appropriate approach. This may include drawing diagrams, looking for patterns, or working backwards[2].\nCarry out the plan: In this step, the chosen strategy is implemented, and calculations are performed. It’s important to check each step for accuracy[2].\nLook back: After obtaining a solution, the problem-solver reviews their work, verifies the result, and considers alternative methods or extensions of the problem[2].\n\nExample 1: Solve the equation 2x + 5 = 13\n\nUnderstand: We need to find the value of x that makes the equation true.\nPlan: Isolate x by subtracting 5 from both sides, then divide by 2.\nExecute: 2x + 5 = 13 2x = 8 x = 4\nLook back: Check if 2(4) + 5 = 13, which it does.\n\nExample 2: Find the area of a rectangle with perimeter 24 cm and length 3 cm longer than its width.\n\nUnderstand: We need to find the area, given the perimeter and a relationship between length and width.\nPlan: Let w be the width. Express length as w + 3. Use the perimeter formula to find w, then calculate the area.\nExecute: 2(w + (w + 3)) = 24 4w + 6 = 24 4w = 18 w = 4.5 cm length = 7.5 cm Area = 4.5 × 7.5 = 33.75 cm²\nLook back: Verify that the perimeter is indeed 24 cm and the length is 3 cm longer than the width."

Some famous theorems include:\n\nFermat’s Last Theorem: Pierre de Fermat claimed in 1637 that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer n &gt; 2. This theorem was finally proved by Andrew Wiles in 1995, after centuries of attempts[3].\nThe Goldbach Conjecture: Proposed by Christian Goldbach in 1742, it states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. While widely believed to be true, it remains unproven[3].\nThe Riemann Hypothesis: Proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, this conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers is considered one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics[3]."

Key concepts include:\n\nSet notation: {1, 2, 3} represents a set containing the elements 1, 2, and 3.\nSubsets: A is a subset of B if every element of A is also in B.\nSet operations: union (∪), intersection (∩), difference (-), complement.\nVenn diagrams: Visual representations of set relationships."
