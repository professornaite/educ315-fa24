    "text": "Gladys West\n\n\nGladys Mae West, born on October 27, 1930, in Sutherland, Virginia, is a pioneering mathematician whose work significantly contributed to the development of the Global Positioning System (GPS). After earning her Bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Virginia State College in 1952 and a Master’s degree in 1955, she began her career at the U.S. Naval Proving Ground, where she developed mathematical models that accurately represented the Earth’s shape, essential for GPS technology.\nGladys West is often referred to as one of the “hidden figures” in the history of NASA and military technology, West’s contributions went largely unrecognized for many years. In 2018, she was inducted into the United States Air Force Hall of Fame and named one of the BBC’s 100 Women, highlighting her legacy in STEM and inspiring future generations, particularly women of color, to pursue careers in science and technology.\nMs. West will serve as one of many examples to guide our questions about teaching mathematics and science. Please watch the below video to help frame your historical analysis assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe site photo is taken from this Hackday article by Al Williams."

This homework is ungraded, and while there is no prerequisite for this course, homework 0 (HW #0) should serve as a review and a preview of content that we’ll explore for the course. Please do not hesitate to reach out with questions.\nExercise 0.1. If an individual’s projected income is to be converted to a z-score, which of these z-scores would a “rational agent” prefer: -2.00, -1.00, 0, 1.00, or 2.00? What is a “rational agent”? Explain why the “rational agent” would prefer the z-score you selected? Cite any sources.\nExercise 0.2. What is an integer? What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? Explain your solution. Cite any sources. Bonus points (but definitely not required for our course): write a proof of the solution.\nExercise 0.3. Have you ever heard of p-hacking? P-hacking is where a researcher conducts multiple tests and only reports the significant results from those tests. What are some main issues here?\nI will not collect hw-0 but I am happy to review it if you’d like; upload it to Canvas here.\n\n\nLab 0\nFor your first lab, you will install two software programs on your local machine: the first is base R and the second is the RStudio Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. Both programs are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must download both R and RStudio!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to complete assignments, you must download base R and RStudio to your computer.\n\n\n\nRStudio is now called Posit. When you are searching online you will begin to see language differences.\nIt can all get very confusing. In order to reduce confusion, I am requesting that you watch this short tutorial so that we’re all on the same page. I will discuss this more when we meet.\n\n\nNext up: Computing\nOn the next page, I will walk you through downloading the appropriate software for our work this term."
