    "text": "This page provides language for your cooperating teachers along information for you both to review related to the expectations of your field placement.\n\nWelcome Letter for Cooperating Teachers\nDear Teacher Colleagues,\nThank you for partnering in our mathematics field experience.\nYour role is crucial in helping to shape the next generation of Howard University prepared educators. This 10-week field placement is designed to provide our students with a comprehensive classroom experience. We ask for your support in guiding them through observations, one-on-one tutoring, and eventually leading a lesson or activities.\nYour mentoring will be invaluable as our pre-service teachers progress from observers to active participants in your classroom. We appreciate your willingness to share your expertise, provide constructive feedback, and create opportunities for our students to apply their learning.\nPlease review the field experience expectations below. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact our field placement coordinator, Dr. Renix, or me, Dr. Nathan Alexander (the instructor for the course).\nThank you again for your commitment to teacher education.\nWarm regards, Prof. Alexander\n\n\nField Log Expectations\nOur future teachers are required to maintain a detailed field experience log throughout their placement. This log serves as a reflective tool and a record of your growth, so they may be taking notes during their time in your classroom. Here are some general expectations for their log:\n\nRegular notes: Make entries during or after each field experience session.\nContent: Include detailed observations, reflections on teaching strategies, notes on student interactions, and personal growth insights. NO student names or personal information should be included.\nStructure: Organize log by date and tunem abd align entries with the weekly tasks and suggestions provided in the schedule here.\nReflection: Include thoughts on what is learned, questions that arise, and ideas for future implementation in your own teaching.\nConnections: Draw links between your observations and the educational theories and methods from class.\nSpecificity: Provide concrete examples and avoid generalizations. Here, you may use pseudonyms or numbers (e.g., student 1, student 2) to protect student privacy.\nProfessional Growth: Document your progression from observer to active teacher, noting challenges and successes along the way.\n\nYour field experience log will be reviewed periodically by your university supervisor and will form part of your overall assessment for the placement.\n\n\nAttendance Expectations\nConsistent attendance is crucial for a meaningful field experience. Here are our course’s attendance expectations:\n\nDuration: The field placement consists of a minimum of two hours per week for 8-10 weeks, totaling 20 hours.\nScheduling: Work with your cooperating teacher to establish a regular schedule that fits both your needs and the classroom’s schedule.\nPunctuality: Arrive at least 10 minutes before your scheduled time to prepare for the day’s activities.\nAbsences: If you must miss a scheduled session due to illness or emergency, notify both your cooperating teacher and Dr. Alexander via email as soon as possible. Arrange to make up any missed time.\nProfessionalism: Treat this experience as you would a job. Dress professionally and adhere to the school’s policies and procedures.\nDocumentation: Record your attendance in your field experience log, including dates, times, and hours completed.\nCompletion: You must complete all 20 hours to receive credit for the field placement. Any shortfall in hours must be made up before the end of the semester."
