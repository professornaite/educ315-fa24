    "text": "Problem Solving\nProblem-solving has been a central focus in mathematics education for decades. The emphasis on problem-solving strategies gained momentum in the 1980s, with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) highlighting its importance in their standards. Since then, various approaches have been developed to enhance students’ problem-solving skills, including heuristic strategies, metacognitive techniques, and collaborative problem-solving.\n\nWho is George Polya?\nGeorge Polya (1887-1985) was a Hungarian mathematician who made significant contributions to various fields of mathematics. He is best known for his work on problem-solving, particularly his book “How to Solve It” (1945), which outlines a systematic approach to problem-solving.\nPolya’s problem-solving approach consists of four main steps:\n\nUnderstand the problem: This step involves carefully reading the problem, identifying key information, and clarifying any unfamiliar terms or concepts.\nDevise a plan: Here, the problem-solver considers various strategies and selects an appropriate approach. This may include drawing diagrams, looking for patterns, or working backwards.\nCarry out the plan: In this step, the chosen strategy is implemented, and calculations are performed. It’s important to check each step for accuracy[2].\nLook back: After obtaining a solution, the problem-solver reviews their work, verifies the result, and considers alternative methods or extensions of the problem[2].\n\nExample 1: Solve the equation 2x + 5 = 13\n\nUnderstand: We need to find the value of x that makes the equation true.\nPlan: Isolate x by subtracting 5 from both sides, then divide by 2.\nExecute: 2x + 5 = 13 2x = 8 x = 4\nLook back: Check if 2(4) + 5 = 13, which it does.\n\nExample 2: Find the area of a rectangle with perimeter 24 cm and length 3 cm longer than its width.\n\nUnderstand: We need to find the area, given the perimeter and a relationship between length and width.\nPlan: Let w be the width. Express length as w + 3. Use the perimeter formula to find w, then calculate the area.\nExecute: 2(w + (w + 3)) = 24 4w + 6 = 24 4w = 18 w = 4.5 cm length = 7.5 cm Area = 4.5 × 7.5 = 33.75 cm²\nLook back: Verify that the perimeter is indeed 24 cm and the length is 3 cm longer than the width."

This 10-week field placement is designed to provide our students with a comprehensive classroom experience. We ask for your support in guiding them through observations, one-on-one tutoring, and eventually leading a lesson or activities.\nYour mentoring will be invaluable as our pre-service teachers progress from observers to active participants in your classroom. We appreciate your willingness to share your expertise, provide constructive feedback, and create opportunities for our students to apply their learning.\nPlease review the field experience expectations below. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact our field placement coordinator, Dr. Renix, or me, Dr. Nathan Alexander (the instructor for the course).\nThank you again for your commitment to teacher education.\nWarm regards, Prof. Alexander\n\n\nField Log Expectations\nOur future teachers are required to maintain a detailed field experience log throughout their placement. This log serves as a reflective tool and a record of your growth, so they may be taking notes during their time in your classroom. Here are some general expectations for their log:\n\nRegular notes: Make entries during or after each field experience session.\nContent: Include detailed observations, reflections on teaching strategies, notes on student interactions, and personal growth insights. NO student names or personal information should be included.\nStructure: Organize log by date and tunem abd align entries with the weekly tasks and suggestions provided in the schedule here.\nReflection: Include thoughts on what is learned, questions that arise, and ideas for future implementation in your own teaching.\nConnections: Draw links between your observations and the educational theories and methods from class.\nSpecificity: Provide concrete examples and avoid generalizations. Here, you may use pseudonyms or numbers (e.g., student 1, student 2) to protect student privacy.\nProfessional Growth: Document your progression from observer to active teacher, noting challenges and successes along the way.\n\nYour field experience log will be reviewed periodically by your university supervisor and will form part of your overall assessment for the placement.\n\n\nAttendance Expectations\nConsistent attendance is crucial for a meaningful field experience. Here are our course’s attendance expectations:\n\nDuration: The field placement consists of a minimum of two hours per week for 8-10 weeks, totaling 20 hours.\nScheduling: Work with your cooperating teacher to establish a regular schedule that fits both your needs and the classroom’s schedule.\nPunctuality: Arrive at least 10 minutes before your scheduled time to prepare for the day’s activities.\nAbsences: If you must miss a scheduled session due to illness or emergency, notify both your cooperating teacher and Dr. Alexander via email as soon as possible. Arrange to make up any missed time.\nProfessionalism: Treat this experience as you would a job. Dress professionally and adhere to the school’s policies and procedures.\nDocumentation: Record your attendance in your field experience log, including dates, times, and hours completed.\nCompletion: You must complete all 20 hours to receive credit for the field placement. Any shortfall in hours must be made up before the end of the semester."

In mathematics, it refers to an amount that can be expressed as a number or a numerical value.\nExamples:\n\nThe number of apples in a basket (discrete quantity)\nThe volume of water in a container (continuous quantity)\nThe temperature of a room (measurable quantity)\nThe speed of a car (derived quantity)\n\nKey points:\n\nQuantities can be discrete (countable) or continuous (measurable)\nQuantities are often associated with units of measurement\nQuantities form the basis for mathematical operations and comparisons\n\nOperation: An operation is a mathematical process or action performed on one or more quantities to produce a new quantity or result. It is a rule for combining mathematical objects or values.\n\nOperations transform quantities into new quantities\nThey follow specific rules and properties (e.g., commutative, associative)\nUnderstanding operations is crucial for problem-solving and algebraic thinking\n\n\nThe primary operations:\nAddition (sum): Combining two or more quantities (e.g., 5 + 3 = 8)\nSubtraction (difference): Finding the difference between quantities (e.g., 10 - 4 = 6)\nMultiplication (product): Repeated addition or scaling (e.g., 3 × 4 = 12)\nDivision (quotient): Distributing a quantity into equal parts (e.g., 15 ÷ 3 = 5)\nExponentiation (exponent): Repeated multiplication (e.g., 2³ = 8)\nRoot extraction (root): Inverse of exponentiation (e.g., √16 = 4)"

    "text": "Concrete-Representational-Abstract (CRA)\nThe Concrete-Representational-Abstract (CRA) process is an instructional approach in mathematics that helps students develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts by progressing through three stages:\n\nConcrete Stage:\n\n\nStudents use physical, hands-on objects to model mathematical concepts\nExamples include base-10 blocks, counters, fraction bars, or algebra tiles\nThis stage allows students to manipulate tangible objects to solve problems\n\n\nRepresentational (or Pictorial) Stage:\n\n\nStudents transition to using visual representations of the concrete objects\nThis may involve drawings, diagrams, or other pictorial models\nExamples include number lines, bar models, or sketches of manipulatives\n\n\nAbstract Stage:\n\n\nStudents work with abstract symbols and notation\nThis includes numbers, variables, and mathematical symbols (+, -, x, ÷)\nStudents apply their understanding to solve problems using standard algorithms\n\nThe CRA approach aims to deepen mathematical understanding, improve problem-solving skills, and help students internalize abstract concepts by first grounding them in concrete experiences."

Allow students to explore and discover patterns through hands-on activities. Gradually connect the concrete models to symbolic notation as students gain understanding."

Umoja’s curriculum begins with a holistic approach, bringing spirit, body, and cultural memory into the learning environments we cultivate for our students and community of practitioners. When students, faculty, and staff attend Umoja’s symposia, institutes, and conferences, they build communal intelligence around identity, culture, career growth, manifestation, and leadership. We draw from educators like bell hooks, Dr. Asa G. Hilliard, Dr. Bettina Love, and Dr. Wade Nobles to uplift the important role of culture, love, and justice in the Umoja classroom and program. We recommend aligning programs, coursework, field trips, etc. to at least one of the goals or objectives from Umoja’s Curriculum.\n Find more information by clicking here"

From 2011-2014, teachers received ongoing training in Common Core implementation, with full implementation occurring during the 2014-15 school year.\nThe CCSS-Mathematics demand a shift in math instruction from an emphasis on procedural fluency towards a balance between procedural fluency, conceptual understanding and application of concepts, so students are better prepared for the critical thinking necessary to succeed in college, careers and their daily lives. OSSE seeks to support high-quality implementation of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.\nFind more information by clicking here"
