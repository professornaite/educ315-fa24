title: "Weekly schedules"
---

This schedule is designed to provide you with a comprehensive and progressive experience during your field experience and covers 8 of the required 10 weeks. The schedule is divided into three main phases: observation (weeks 1-4), support and individual tutoring (weeks 5-6), and mini-lessons and whole class activities (weeks 7-10). This structure will allow you to gradually build your skills and confidence in supporting mathematics instruction, moving from passive observation to active teaching. Each week focuses on a specific aspect of math instruction or student interaction.

To maximize the benefits of your field placement, you are required to maintain a detailed field placement log. This log should track all the information outlined in the third column of the schedule below. Your log entries should include the date, specific observation notes, reflections on teaching strategies, notes on student interactions, and your personal growth throughout the experience. Pay particular attention to documenting the progression of your involvement, from initial observations to leading class activities. This log will serve as a valuable resource for your professional development, helping you identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. Additionally, it will provide concrete examples and experiences to draw upon during future job interviews or when developing your teaching philosophy.
